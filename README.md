## Continuous Integration CI
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI) to automate the testing and deployment process. The CI pipeline is configured to run tests and perform other tasks whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that the codebase remains stable and that any issues are caught early in the development process.

Workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory, and you can customize them to fit your project's needs. The CI pipeline includes steps for running tests, checking code quality, and deploying the application to a staging or production environment.

- Tests: The application includes a suite of tests to ensure that the code is functioning as expected. These tests are run automatically as part of the CI pipeline.
- Code Quality: The CI pipeline includes steps to check the code quality using tools like PHPStan and PHP CS Fixer. This helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase.
- Deployment: The CI pipeline can be configured to automatically deploy the application to a staging or production environment whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that the latest version of the application is always available to users.
